👋 Hi, I’m @maujo227
👀 I’m a pharmacist interested in coding
🌱 I’m currently learning coding with Python with Visual Code Studio
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project with Python for a Casual Chat website.

🚧 Project status

This project was started as an initial prototype, but is currently not actively maintained. I currently don't have time to actively develop this project, but I believe it has potential. If anyone is interested in contributing, improving, come forward! I would be happy if others would like to contribute, fork it or carry it forward!
Contributions, bug reports and forks are welcome 🙌
